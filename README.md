# Secure Chat System (ChaCha20-Poly1305)

This project is a secure chat system that uses ChaCha20 for encryption and Poly1305 for message authentication. It ensures that all messages are:

Confidential – only intended recipients can read messages.

Authenticated – messages cannot be tampered with undetected.

Integrity-protected – messages are verified before decryption.

The system is built with modern cryptography practices and demonstrates an end-to-end encryption (E2EE) approach.
